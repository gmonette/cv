https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvTools/
not actively developed
no vignettes
repeated CV but no parallel computation
naive algorithm
similar design to our cv() in some respects

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvwrapr/index.html
not old but apparently not actively developed
awkward structure to main kfoldcv() function, not extensible(?),
  takes matrix rather than model input
vignettes and docs very basic
supports parallel computation
naive algorithm

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/groupdata2
creates folds, must write or find function for CV

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlexperiments/
novel R6 approach
a few "learner" function supplied, otherwise must be programmed
not model-based
has vignettes

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/origami/
focuses on creating folds; user supplies a function to compute
  CV criterion for each fold
not model-based
has vignette

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveyCV/
for complex surveys, using survey package
essentially limited to linear and logistic regression
with lower-level programming can be adapted to other
  models
