Web Pages for Cross Validation Packages on CRAN

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caret/ $$$
incorporates CV as part of model-selection process; provides interface to regression functions in many existing R packages.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crossval/
not actively developed since 2014
no vignettes/weak documentation
no parallel computation, naive algorithm

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvms/ $$$
extensive vignettes/docs
cross_validate() for (G)L(M)Ms
naive algorithm
parallel computation supported
pre-process for folds
actively developed
nested CV apparently similar to our recursive CV
similar in general approach to rsample

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvTools/
not actively developed
no vignettes
repeated CV but no parallel computation
naive algorithm
similar design to our cv() in some respects

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cvwrapr/index.html
not old but apparently not actively developed
awkward structure to main kfoldcv() function, not extensible(?),
  takes matrix rather than model input
vignettes and docs very basic
supports parallel computation
naive algorithm

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/groupdata2
creates folds, must write or find function for CV

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlexperiments/ $$$
novel R6 approach
a few "learner" function supplied, otherwise must be programmed
not model-based
has vignettes
** evaluate further

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/origami/ $$$
focuses on creating folds; user supplies a function to compute
  CV criterion for each fold
not model-based
has vignette

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsample/ $$$
** evaluate further
use as comparison?

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveyCV/
for complex surveys, using survey package
essentially limited to linear and logistic regression
with lower-level programming can be adapted to other
  models

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyfit/ $$$
** evaluate further
similar to caret
CV only incidental (using rsample)


features of cv package:

model-based
simple interface through cv()
extensible if necessary
takes advantage of computational efficiencies (e.g., Woodbury, parallel computations)
novel or unusual features: supports mixed models, cross-validates model-specification including via recursive CV
