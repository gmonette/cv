Thank you for reading the paper and replication script so carefully. We've addressed both of the issues you identified:

(1) We intentionally didn't set the seed in the call to cv() in (cv.auto <- cv(m.auto, confint = TRUE)) to show that cv() sets, saves, and reports the seed to make the results replicable. We can make our paper and script replicable by setting the seed *outside* of the call to cv(). We've now done that, invisibly in the paper and visibly in the replication script.

(2) Yes, Fig. 9 was incorrect in the replication script (we failed to update it to correspond to the revised paper); it's now fixed. We apologize for the error.

By the way, here and in a few other places, the results in the replication script include what's shown in the paper but add some more information -- here, panels for the factors in the model. In this case, we saved space in the paper by omitting these panels, which don't show the effect of transforming the numeric predictors (that is, what we want to check in these C+R plots).
